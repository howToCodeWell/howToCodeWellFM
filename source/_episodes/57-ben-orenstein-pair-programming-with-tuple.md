Ben Orenstein is a co founder of a pair programming tool called [Tuple](https://tuple.app) that allows remote developers to share and alter code in realtime.

Ben joins me to talk about Tuple and what pair programming is.

Ben is also a speaker, singer and Ruby developer. We talk about his coding background and how he came up with the idea of Tuple
