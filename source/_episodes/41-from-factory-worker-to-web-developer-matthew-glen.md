Matthew Glen joins me on the How To Code Well podcast to talk about changing careers from factory worker to web developer.

We talk about why he decided to change his career and how he started to learn web development.

Matthew has a very inspirational development story, he talks about the challenges he faced and how he overcame them. He also gives some great advice to self taught developers and those looking to switch careers to work in the web development industry.

if you are looking to get into the industry and need some encouragement then I strongly suggest listening to Matthew Glen as he talks us through his career progression.
