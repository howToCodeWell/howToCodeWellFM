In today's podcast [Chris Ginn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisginn1) and I do a deep dive into Agile.

[Chris is an Agile Delivery Lead](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisginn1) and was first on the podcast in [episode 78 where he talked about his career journey from a DBA to an ADL](https://bit.ly/2DYBn4Y). 

Chris shares his extensive knowledge about the Agile delivery process and breaks down the Agile methodologies into easy to understand segments whilst explaining the delivery of a typical system.
We discuss how a company can transition into an Agile work flow and Chris explains the typical Agile ceremonies such as sprint planning, daily scrums, sprint review, sprint retrospective and backlog refinements.
