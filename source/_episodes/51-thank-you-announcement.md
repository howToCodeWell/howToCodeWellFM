2019 is nearly over and I want to take this time to thank everyone who has listened to the podcast and to all the amazing guests that have been on the show.

I am also announcing the New Year Podcast special which is happening next Friday!

It's going to be super fun so make sure you have [subscribed to the YouTube channel](http://bit.ly/2wf9ufB).

Have a great new year everyone!

Happy Coding :)
