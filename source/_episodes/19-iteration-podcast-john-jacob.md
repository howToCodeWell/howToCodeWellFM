John Jacob from the Iteration podcast is today's guest on How To Code Well. We talk about how the Iteration podcast started and what programming books have been reviewed. We also discuss how John and JP met and what happened to first season of the Iteration podcast. John explains how he got into web development and built his freelance career at better.dev

The Iteration podcast hosted by John Jacob and JP. Each episode covers a chapter in a programming book. I recommend the podcast to both junior and senior developers who would like to gain knowledge in programming practices, coding principles and exposure to other programming languages.

John Jacob is also the founder of better.dev, a software company that specialises in building websites and apps with a focus on sustainability and simplicity.
