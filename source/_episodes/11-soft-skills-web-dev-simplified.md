Having good soft skills is crucial for every employee and in any industry as they are required when working with and for others. As web developers we work with both technical and non technical team members. We may also communicate with clients or end users who have a set of requirements and needs that we must identify and fulfil.

Kyle Cook joins me in this podcast episode to discuss the importance of having soft skills in web development. Kyle has a vast amount of web development tutorials on his Web Dev Simplified Youtube Channel
