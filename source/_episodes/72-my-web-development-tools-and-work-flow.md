Whilst live coding on Twitch I was asked about my web development work flow, the different types of tools that I use and what to expect when progressing in a career in web development.

In this episode I am going to answer all of this and more. Â We are going to cover why I use Jira more than Trello to record tasks. What frameworks I have mostly been using and what to expect as you advance in web development.
