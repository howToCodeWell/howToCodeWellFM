Here are my predictions for web development in 2019.

1) PWA (Progressive Web Apps) will be as/more popular then AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages)
2) GraphQL will not replace REST
3) Microsoft will embrace more OSS
4) JavaScript to have another big NPM security issue
5) More vendors supporting serverless
6) More web assembly awesomeness

I explain each of these points and what they mean for web development in 2019
