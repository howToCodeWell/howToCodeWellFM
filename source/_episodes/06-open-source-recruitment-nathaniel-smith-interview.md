Today's podcast guest is Nathaniel Smith from Socially Responsible Recruitment (SR2). Nathaniel is an open source recruiter who specialises in PHP and Javascript recruitment.

I've personally met Nathaniel over a few beers at PHPSouthWest and I am very impressed with the approach of Socially Responsible Recruitment.

Nathaniel discusses the web development trends he sees when recruiting for PHP or JavaScript positions and give advice on how junior developers can improve their chances of getting a job in the web development industry.
