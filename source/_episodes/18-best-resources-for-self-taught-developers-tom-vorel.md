Tom Vorel is a self taught react developer and joins me on the How To Code Well podcast to talk about the best resources for self taught web developers

In this video Tom talks about the different ways of learning how to code using podcasts, online and offline courses as well as books and other resources.

This is the second time Tom has been on the podcast. In his first episode he discusses [how he became a self taught react developer](https://howtocodewell.fm/episode/04-from-self-taught-coder-to-react-developer-tom-vorel-interview/).
