Matt Trask joins me on today's podcast to talk about Open Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI) and why mental health is important in Web Development

Matt Trask is senior PHP developer, open source contributor, speaker, OSMI volunteer and keen cyclist.

If you are suffering from mental health please speak to someone about it. Web developers are not immune from suffering from poor mental health. Please look after yourself.
Happy Coding
