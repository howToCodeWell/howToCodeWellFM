Today's podcast is going to be a bit different as Jeremy Onion interviews me.

Jeremy asks me about my web development journey, my educational background and what programming languages I have learnt.

We also discuss my web development career and how I became a freelance web developer and consultant.

Jeremy asked questions about the YouTube channel and the story behind How To Code Well.  We also discuss future plans and what might be happening in the future with the How To Code Well community.
