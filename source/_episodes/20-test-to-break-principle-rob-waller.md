Rob Waller is today's guest on the How To Code Well podcast. Rob talks about testing code and testing an application for failures and expected outcomes.

Rob Waller is a software developer with a background in managing development teams. He is also a speaker and has given many talks on software testing.

We discuss the best way to test legacy code, how to explain the importance of testing to stakeholders and the difference between testing for failure and expected outcomes.

We also talk about Rob's interview on CNN. Rob created an application that found fake followers on Twitter. This app was used during a previous US election by many journalists.
