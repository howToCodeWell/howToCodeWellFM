I have created a [beginner friendly HTML, CSS and JavaScript course](http://patreon.com/howToCodeWell).  This is quite different from the other courses that we have on HTCW because this is project based. You will be developing a Tip Calculator and this project includes three tutorials. 
This is a free course that will be published on [howtocodewell.net](http://howtocodewell.net) and [YouTube](http://youtube.com/howtocodewell).  The code is available to supports of the HTCW
In this episode I talk about the course and future project based courses on HTCW. I also discuss the future of HTCW and when I plan to upgrade PHP to version 8.
