Matt Brunt is my guest on today's How To Code Well podcast. Matt is a web developer, public speaker and mentor. Matt talks about his background in web development including his experiences at university and how having a sandwich degree helped him get a job in the industry.

Matt is a fantastic public speaker and has some great advice for developers who are speaking at conferences. Matt's upcoming talks are 'Think Like A Hacker' at GOTO Berlin and DDD East Midlands in October. See [Matt's website](https://mfyu.co.uk/talks) for more details
