    description: "Big software news as Microsoft drops PHP windows support. In this episode I talk about what this could mean for Windows based PHP developers"
---
In a message to the PHP externals, Microsoft has announced that it is dropping Windows support for PHP 8 and beyond.

In this episode I am going to discuss what this means for Windows based PHP developers.

I will also be asking questions, highlighting developer concerns and making recommendations to those learning PHP on Windows development environments.
