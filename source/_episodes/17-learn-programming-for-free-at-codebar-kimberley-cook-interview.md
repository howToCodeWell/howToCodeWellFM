Kimberley Cook joins me on the How To Code Well podcast to discuss learning to code at codebar.

codebar is a non-profit initiative that facilitates the growth of a diverse tech community by running regular programming workshops.

The codebar workshops cover several programming topics and languages such as python, javascript, android, ruby and more.

There is no technical requirements when being a student at codebar. You can be a complete beginner with no coding skills or programming experience. The codebar workshops are held all over the world at many tech companies such as Twitter in London and Google in New York

Kimberley and I also talk about how to become a codebar coach and what skills you need to teach and mentor coding students.

Checkout the website ([codebar.io](https://codebar.io)) and sign up as a student to start your learning journey.
You can also signup as a coach and share your coding skills.

Kimberley is a director at codebar and a freelance web developer. Kimberley is also a keen snowboarder.
