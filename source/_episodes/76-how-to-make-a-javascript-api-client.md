What is an API client compared to an API endpoint and how do you build, test and document a API client? These are some of the questions that I answer in today's podcast. 
Essentially an API client is bit like a Software Development Kit (SDK)   

In this episode I talk about how I am developing a JavaScript API client using tools such as Jest, Nock, Babel, EsLint and Documentation.js
