Docker is a fantastic tool to have in your web development tool box. 

Here are some of the 19 Docker tips and techniques that I wish I knew when I started using Docker.

- Use Docker Compose even if you have one container
- Learn the difference between a bind mount and a data volume
- Use the —rm flag for creating one off scripts in a container
- Use a Docker ignore file
- Use multi stage builds
- Use Docker system prune to remove dead and unused Docker objects
- Use Dive to see what can be removed
- Don’t carry build tools in production
- Learn the difference between ARG and ENV
