Oliver Davies joins me to talk about Static Site Generators on the How To Code Well Podcast.

Static Site Generators are becoming very popular in web development and they come in many shapes and sizes which cater for different website requirements.  Many web development programming languages have their own flavours of static site generators such as Jeklly for Ruby, Sculpin for PHP and Gatsby for JavaScript. 

Oliver and I have both built many websites using static site generators and are aware of some of the pros and cons to using them.  We discuss this what static site generators are, when to use them and more importantly when not too.
