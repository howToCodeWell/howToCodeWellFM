Matt Stauffer joins me on the How To Code Well podcast to talk about why Laravel is so good!

Matt is a technical director at 'Tighten', author, Twitch streamer, speaker and podcast host.  He builds web systems with Laravel and other PHP related technologies and teaches Laravel on Twitch and his YouTube channel 

We talk about the difference between Laravel and other frameworks such as Zend and Symfony. Matt also gives some great advice to those looking to use Laravel as a PHP framework.
