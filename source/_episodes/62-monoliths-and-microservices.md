    description: "What are Microservices and Monoliths"
---
Today we are going to discuss the rebuild of [howtocodewell.net](http://howtocodewell.net) using a microservice architecture. 

The current site is a basic Monolith and I would like to improve it with e-commerce and e-learning features.  These features will be based on many Microservices. 

We are going to talk about some of the things that I've found difficult during the development stage of the project. We are also going to discuss some of the advantages and disadvantages of using a Microservices architecture.
