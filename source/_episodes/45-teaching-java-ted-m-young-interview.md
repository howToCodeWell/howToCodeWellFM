Ted M Young joins me on the How To Code Well podcast to talk about teaching Java and live coding on Twitch

Ted has a fascinating coding background which began at the age of 13 building stock programs that drew analytical charts. Ted sold the program to Dow Jones and become a very young professional programmer.

In his adult programming career Ted has worked for eBay, Google and other very well known software companies.

Ted is a well known Java programmer and coach. He teaches Java to classes of students and regularly live codes on Twitch. We discuss the teaching process and Ted gives some really good advice for coding trainers and up coming live coders.
