Gary Hockin joins me on the How To Code Well podcast to talk about live coding on Twitch and working at Twilio.

Gary is a developer evangelist at Twilio, international speaker, senior PHP developer and gamer.  As part of his role at Twilio Gary live codes on Twitch and interacts heavily with the programming community.

In the interview we talk about the many great things that Twilio does for developers and what products they offer for their clients.

We also discuss Gary's coding background and how he became a speaker.
