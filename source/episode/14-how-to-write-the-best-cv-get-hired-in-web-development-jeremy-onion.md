Jeremy Onion joins me on the How To Code Well podcast to discuss the web development recruitment process. Jeremy gives some valuable tips on how to write the best CV and explains what requirements are needed when applying for a new role in web development.

The topics we cover will help new developers applying for their first web development job and developers looking to progress in their development careers.  Jeremy talks in detail about how to write a cover letter, what to include in a personal statement and how to structure your CV.

Jeremy is a Technical director at the [Torpedo Group](https://torpedogroup.com). His role includes hiring the right developers for many roles in web development.

Torpedo is hiring new developers!
