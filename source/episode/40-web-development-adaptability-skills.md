Being able to adapt to different circumstances is very important in a web developers career. In this podcast I discuss certain ways to improve your adaptability skills and how to alter to new situations.
We talk about accepting inevitable changes and how to cope with uncertainty. 

I also take this opportunity to talk about the podcast in general and mention who will be  on the show in the future.
