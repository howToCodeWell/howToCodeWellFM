Today Stephen Doherty is my guest on the How To Code Well podcast and talks about learning to code over 30.

Stephen is from the US and before he turned 30 worked in the family business as a life accident and  health insurance agent.  Once Stephen turned 30 he decided to learn how to code and is now a full time web developer working in a digital agency. 

Stephen talks about how he taught himself how to code whilst working in a totally different career and his experiences of becoming a web developer.
