PHP 5.6 has reached End Of Life (EOL). There will be many developers who are looking to upgrade to PHP 7 but before the upgrade can be made lots of decisions, testing and adjustments need to be made. At the time of recording the stable version of PHP is 7.3

This is discussion about upgrading PHP from the perspective of a freelance web developer. We talk about the tools needed to upgrade PHP and the best way to go about making the change.
