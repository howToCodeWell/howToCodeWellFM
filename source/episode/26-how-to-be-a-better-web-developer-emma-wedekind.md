We discuss the many aspects of improving as a Web Developer including technical, soft and hard skills.  We also talk about previous experiences that we've  had in our own development journeys.
Emma has a lot of experience in Programming, Leadership and Web Development and shares a lot of advice for both junior and senior Web Developers.
