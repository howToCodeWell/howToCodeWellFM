Today I interview Tom Vorel who has recently had his first week in his first web development job. He is a self taught web developer who studied Javascript, HTML, CSS and other disciplines whilst having another full time job.

In this video Tom talks about how he went from being a self taught developer to being a full time React developer. We talk about his learning journey, the challenges he faced and how he moved into the industry.

Tom also discusses the resources he used to learn and develop his coding skill set.

Tom's story is very inspirational and encouraging for those wanting to get into the web development industry. He gives lots of advice for first time developers and coders.

Tom is now working as a React developer and I wish him well for the future.
