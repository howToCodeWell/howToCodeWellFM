I interviewed Antonio Radovcic about his laptop stickers project called [DevLids](http://devlids.com). 

Antonio Radovcic is a frontend developer at Valtech in Germany and has created DevLids to display stickered laptops from tech/design/science-related fields.

You can see [my laptop DevLid](https://devlids.com/lids/pfwd) on the site:
